# Creating the tidy datafile


# Guide to create the tidy data file
The data file was created by organizing the data frames in variables, and merging both: the 
training data and the subject data together.

#Cleaning of the data
All data was organized in different variables and then was structured via R, using internal functions and the dyplr library.

#Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file

These are the Identifiers used by the script :

Subject: the ID of the Subject
